    <blockquote>A server is a system (software and suitable computer hardware)
            that responds to requests across a computer network to provide, or help to provide, a network service.
            Servers can be run on a dedicated computer, which is also often
            referred to as "the server", but many networked computers are
            capable of hosting servers. In many cases, a computer can provide
            several services and have several servers running. &nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">...more</a> (on Wiki).</blockquote>
